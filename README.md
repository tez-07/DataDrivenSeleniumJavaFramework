# Data-Driven Testing (DDT)

Data-Driven Testing (DDT) is a software testing technique where test data is separated from test scripts. The same test runs multiple times with different sets of input data, such as different usernames and passwords for login functionality.

## Why Use Data-Driven Testing?
- Reduces duplication in test scripts
- Tests the same feature with multiple input combinations (valid/invalid)
- Makes it easier to automate repetitive tests

## How to Build a Basic Data-Driven Framework
- Install **JDK** and configure environment variables.  
- Install **Eclipse IDE for Enterprise and Web Development**.  
- Create a new **Maven Project** using `maven-archetype-quickstart`.  
- Delete the autogenerated folders and create a custom project structure.  
- Write test classes (e.g., `Login.java`) with `@Test` annotations.  
- Replace **JUnit** dependency with **TestNG** and install the TestNG plugin in Eclipse.  
- Write **Selenium** test code for login functionality.  
- Use `@AfterTest` to quit the browser after the tests have run.  
- Create a `@DataProvider` method with a 2D array of test data (multiple credentials).  
- Create a `src/test/resources` folder for storing test data files.  
- Add utility classes like `MYXLSReader.java` for reading Excel files using **Apache POI** dependencies.  
- Update the `@DataProvider` to fetch data from Excel instead of hardcoded arrays.  
- Use **HashMap** in data methods for more flexibility.  
- Create a **Base class** (`Base.java`) to initialize browsers and set up the environment.  
- Extend the base class in your test classes.  
- Implement logic to run only tests where `runmode = "Y"`. 

## Dependencies
- Apache POI (for Excel reading)
- TestNG (for test framework)
- Selenium Java

This setup helps create maintainable and reusable automated tests that can run with varied data inputs easily.
