# Data-Driven Testing (DDT)

Data-Driven Testing (DDT) is a software testing technique where test data is separated from test scripts. The same test runs multiple times with different sets of input data, such as different usernames and passwords for login functionality.

## Why Use Data-Driven Testing?
- Reduces duplication in test scripts
- Tests the same feature with multiple input combinations (valid/invalid)
- Makes it easier to automate repetitive tests

## How to Build a Basic Data-Driven Framework
1. Install JDK and set up environment variables  
2. Install Eclipse IDE for Enterprise and Web Development  
3. Create a new Maven project using the `maven-archetype-quickstart` archetype  
4. Delete autogenerated folders and create your own structure  
5. Write test classes (e.g., `Login.java`) with `@Test` annotations  
6. Replace JUnit dependency with TestNG and add TestNG plugin in Eclipse  
7. Write Selenium test code for login functionality  
8. Use `@AfterTest` to quit the browser after tests run  
9. Create a DataProvider method with a 2D array of test data (multiple credentials)  
10. Create a `src/test/resources` folder for test data files  
11. Add utility classes like `MYXLSReader.java` for reading Excel files (use Apache POI dependencies)  
12. Change DataProvider to fetch data from Excel instead of hardcoded arrays  
13. Use HashMaps in data methods for better flexibility  
14. Create a base class (`base.java`) to initialize browsers and set up the environment  
15. Extend the base class in your test classes and implement logic to run only enabled tests (runmode "Y")

## Dependencies
- Apache POI (for Excel reading)
- TestNG (for test framework)
- Selenium Java

This setup helps create maintainable and reusable automated tests that can run with varied data inputs easily.
